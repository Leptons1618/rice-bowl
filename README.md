   chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
   ```

   ```

### Additional dependencies

For full functionality of the provided config, install:

```bash
sudo pacman -S fortune-mod cowsay lolcat ranger

## Customization

The configuration files are made to be dynamic, automatically detecting your environment and adjusting paths accordingly. However, you may want to customize the Oh My Posh theme or other settings.

To preview and select a different theme:
```bash
ls ~/.poshthemes
oh-my-posh init fish --config ~/.poshthemes/THEME_NAME.omp.json | source
```

Then edit the `config.fish` file to set your preferred theme.
